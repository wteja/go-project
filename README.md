# Go Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of my side projects and experiments written in Go. It serves as a workspace for learning, prototyping, and building various tools and applications using the Go programming language.

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains an individual project. For example:

- `task-tracker-cli/` — A simple CLI tool for managing tasks

More projects and experiments will be added over time.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wteja/go-projects.git
